This being the first challenge is the most simplest one.

Both the username and password are provided. Therefore all you have to do is execute the ssh command with the provided values

Hint 1: Required params are username, hostname and port. By default the port is 22, so you don't need to specify it usually. But in this case, a different port has been provided. Check the man page for ssh to see what is the option to specify port number.

Hint 2: Still stuck? Its ok! Here's the command and what the result of a successful login will look like.
